		<p>A little bit about myself: I'm currently a grad student at the University of
    Michigan studying Human-Computer Interaction. I've always loved reading and losing
    myself in other people's worlds, stories, and lives. In fact, as a middle
    schooler, I used to always have a book in the back of my mom's car, and on the 25
    minute drives to and from school I would be engrossed in my current read - completely
    ignoring my mom! Unfortunately, over the course of the first three years of undergrad,
    I found myself not making time to read, and I wasn't able to enjoy one of my
    favorite hobbies. But when the pandemic hit and I had more time on my hands than
    I ever could have imagined, I quickly reignited my love and passion for reading,
    have been discovering and re-discovering some of favorite books.</p>

    <p>To share my passion, and ignite a little light of passion in all of you, I give
    you my book nook! I hope you enjoy looking through my favorite books, my last reads,
    and my reading tips & tricks. Thank you for joining me on my reading journey, and
    I am honored to be a part of yours.</p>
