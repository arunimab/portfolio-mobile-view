        <p>Intrested in getting into reading yourself? Or already love books but can't seem
          to find the time to spend reading them? No worries at all, you're in the right
          place! I have certainly been in the latter position myself, and have found some
          handy tips and tricks to not only get myself out of a reading slump, but to make
          time for myself to enjoy books even when I am incredibly busy (which I often
          am as a grad student)!</p>

        <h2>Invest in an e-Reader</h2>
        <p>
          In our digital age, nothing beats the ease and convenience of an e-Reader, and
          investing in one can put you on the path to success in your reading journey!
          Not only do e-Readers involve a financial investment, which makes you more likely
          to actually keep up with your reading to make use of your investment, these devices
          are also incredibly easy to carry around, so you can read anywhere from the bus
          to a dentist waiting room.</p>

      <div class="tip2">
        <h2>Audiobooks are your Best Friend!</h2>
        <p>If you don't love sitting in one place and having to physically read a book, then
          audiobooks are a great way to enjoy books! Even as someone who has always loved
          physical books or the act of physically reading, audiobooks are so nice to listen
          to as I go around the house completing chores or while making the commute to school
          or work.</p>

        <h2>Take Advantage of your Local Library</h2>
        <p>Your local library makes it incredibly easy to access a wide range of books, and
          they can help you discover the books that match your reading interests. And all
          without costing an extra cent! It's as easy as googling your nearest library and
          signing up for a library card. I promise you, you will not regret it!</p>
        <p>Additionally, if physical books aren't your thing, you can still access your
          libraries resources digitally. Most libraries have eBooks and audiobooks available
          for checkouts via Libby, an iOS and Android app. Millions of books are literally
          right at your finger tips!</p>

        <h2>Make Reading a Part of your Routine</h2>
        <p>Since nobody is really making you read everyday, it's easy to say "Oh I'll just read
          tomorrow!" But as we all know, that tomorrow never comes. Tomorrow becomes the day after,
          which becomes the day after, and so on. The best way to fight this never-ending
          postponing of something you want to make time for is to make a part of a routine,
          even if it adds just five minutes. For example, if you like to wake-up in the morning
          and make yourself a cup of coffee, grab a book to enjoy as you drink your coffee.
          Or if you like to watch Netflix or Youtube before going to bed, maybe switch out
          that last episode for a chapter of a book instead. This way, we can actually make
          time for the things that matter.</p>
